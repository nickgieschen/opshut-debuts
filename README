heroku local:run ./build/install/debuts/bin/debuts -t addtostash

Yearly, we need to update the leagueId (e.g. 370.l.46651). We need to update both the game Id (370) and the leagueId (46651). We also need to update the Stash team Ids.

We need to set the clientId and clientSecret of the owner of stash. Get them here: https://developer.yahoo.com/apps/

When refreshing the OAuth access token, it should be done while signed in as the owner of stash.
